    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",
    "   - Set records with \"<=50K\" to `0` and records with \">50K\" to `1`."

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "* The model can be used in the Healthcare industry to detect a potential disease based on patient lifestyle, genetic factors, or medical history.\n",
    "* The algorithm from the Random Forest model achieves very high predictive accuracy, often higher than many other machine learning models. This is known as the advanced algorithm of the Decision Tree model, which will help to eliminate the overfitting issue often occurring in the Decision Tree model. The Random Forest model can also process directly on the high dimension and mixed data set, including numerical and categorical, without requiring preprocessing the data, making the process easier. \n",
    "* The algorithm also has some weaknesses, such as being time-consuming, consuming a large amount of memory, and potentially having an overfit issue. The model will generate many decision tree algorithms, which will take time and consume much memory if the training data set is large and high-dimensional. The overfit issue could happen when allowing the model to learn deeply or handling a noisy dataset. \n",
    "* The Random Forest model could be a good model to predict individual income based on the census dataset because it includes numerical and category data types. The census data also has a high-dimensional structure, and the numerical data are normalized. This could eliminate the overfitting issue, which is often a potential issue of the Random Forest model. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The second model is the Adaptive Boost model.\n",
    "* The model is mostly used in fraud detection applications in the financial industry. The complex algorithm could be effective in capturing unusual transactions that could be fraudulent. \n",
    "* The model's most potent strength is its ability to learn from itself, which involves many repeating processes of learning and relearning from weak learners. The algorithm can connect the dataset's complex relationship and consider each feature's importance in that complex relationship. The Adaptive Boost model can be applied very well to categorical and preprocessed numerical data, which helps understand the importance of the dataset's features. \n",
    "* The Adaptive Boost model has some limitations in handling data with outliers and noise, which can cause a significant bias in the prediction and a negative impact on defining the weight for features.\n",
    "* The reasons to choose the Adaptive Boost model are similar to those for using the Random Forest model. They both work great in the dataset with numerical and categorical data. More than that, the data normalization process helps eliminate noisy data and outliers, which will help train the Adaptive Boost model better. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The third model is the Support Vector Machine model.\n",
    "* The Support Vector Machine model is also used to diagnose a potential disease based on the patient's genes, symptoms, medical history, and test results. \n",
    "* The algorithm is robust. The kernel trick on non-linear relationships can help map a decision boundary with high-dimensional spaces. Another strength of the model is having a pre-defined C parameter, which controls the algorithm's overfitting issue. The Support Vector Machine model will perform well on the high-dimensional dataset and prevent the overfitting issue.\n",
    "* The greatest weakness of the Support Vector Machine is its time consumption, which could take significantly longer than other algorithms to train and predict. The second weakness is finding a good combination for the C and kernel hyper-parameters. The Support Vector Machine model will not be an option when the case highly considers saving time to train data and predict results. The model could be less effective if the data is also very noisy. \n",
    "* In the CharityMl case, if the accuracy of the prediction is more important than saving time training the model, then the Support Vector Machine model should be considered a good model to implement.\n"

    " * Training process: The coach will apply the strategy the practice with each of the players to learn their strengths and weaknesses, then use the strengths and weaknesses of the first player to compare with the strengths and weaknesses of the second player, then the coach can weight their skills to address them in a suitable position in the team and continues the process to all the players. That training process will increase the chance of winning the championship, and that could be understood as the more the model trained will generate, the better prediction for the future.  \n",

In this case, the weak learner is considered an algorithm; the first algorithm can apply and learn on a small subset of the training set about the **education_level** feature. In the following algorithm, the second weak learner will use and learn on the more significant subset of training data, including the **education_level** and **age** features from the predicting result. It will consider which features (**education_level** or **age**) have the higher impact on the result and assign a different weight to each feature. The next weak learner will apply the same process on the more significant subset, including **education_level**, **age**, and **sex** features... until all the training data is applied, then the Adaptive Boost model is ready to fed by the future data to generate the prediction.

    "* ***First, the result from the machine learning model is more significant than a human belief because of the potential bias from existing human knowledge. In contrast, the machine learning model is based on statistics and probability. But there are some reasonable explanations I can make based on the comparison between results:***\n",
    "\n",
    " * The most influential feature is **capital loss** instead of **capital gain**, which makes sense to me because **capital loss** represents an individual's financing hardship. For example, it could be an individual experiencing an unproductive business. \n",
    " * The second most important feature is **age**, instead of **occupation**, which could be understood as reflecting the experience level at the entry-level, mid-level, or senior level in their career, which can impact the income level of that individual. The age feature also trains the model to identify the different retirement groups and working groups of individuals, for example, defining who is older or less than 65 years old. \n",
    " * The third most important is **capital gain**, which I thought should be the first element to define the individual's income. However, it also makes sense because it could be the gross income before subtracting the loss from the business, so the capital gain must have a strong relationship with the capital loss in this case. \n",
    " * The fourth most important feature is **hours per week**, which is that the higher amount of hours worked will positively impact the predictive income of individuals, and the lower amount of working hours will negatively impact the predictive income of individuals. For example, the updated minimum pay in the Bay area is ~ 18 dollars/hour if an individual who works in a server position can earn more than 56,000 dollars (before any bonus) a year if they work 60 hours a week.  \n",
    " * The **education number** is the binary version of the **education level**, which is also a key feature in predicting individual income. The census dataset provides a specific education level of each individual, such as master's level, bachelor's level, high school, 9th grade, etc., and the chance of earning more income tends to belong to individuals with a higher level of education. \n",

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
